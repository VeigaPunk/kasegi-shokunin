# kasegi-shokunin — Iteration Log

- 2026-09-28 — round 0: minted as shonen.
- 2026-09-28 — round 1: rewrote SKILL.md from a seed stub into grounded craft.
  Evidence walked: `/home/vgpnk/Projects/bounties` — 275 claim dirs under
  `claims/`, 1088 `bounty-map/programs/*.json` records, `docs/claim-runbook.md`
  (operator-gated submission contract), `docs/claim-ready-index.md` (12-item
  queue + blocked gates), `docs/continuation-notes.md` (486-mission partition:
  438 LEARNED honest-zero, 19 RETIRED auth-walled, 26 FAILED-infra, 3
  RETRY-method), `docs/wrap-report.md` (7 packages, 0 clean GO — all
  disclosure-class fixes), `docs/review-verdicts.jsonl` (430 leave / 50
  continue / 6 drop), `docs/autopsies/` (auth-wall/terms-gate retirements),
  `fleets/mission-template.md` (AR14 standing grant + six-file package spec),
  `ops/ev-report.mjs` (fail-closed adjusted-EV formula), exemplar packages
  `claims/cantina-pendle/ingestion-20260915/` (positive-blocked) and
  `claims/bugcrowd-seek/honest-zero/` (terminal honest-zero). New SKILL.md
  carries: pipeline, scope-snapshot checklist, per-platform policy playbook,
  finding-triage decision table, evidence-package anatomy with status.json
  gate semantics, 10 observed disclosure anti-patterns, EV model, cited paths.
  Corpus added per `../CORPUS.md`: `corpus/README.md` index + coverage map,
  `corpus/knowledge/` (claim-package-contract, policy-access-playbook,
  ev-model, terminal-classes, program-quirks — all sourced),
  `corpus/lessons/round-1.md` (what worked/friction/gaps).
- 2026-09-28 — round 3: closed the gate-list gap and walked the VDP corpus.
  Read `ops/claim-check.mjs` (full 233 lines), `ops/claim-index.mjs`,
  `ops/prepare-claims.mjs` → `corpus/knowledge/claim-gates.md` (complete gate
  inventory: file presence, content markers, manifest/redaction binding,
  custodian 3-way head binding, secrets regex, status.json gates incl. the
  GLOBAL duplicate-submission scan and literal `kx-reviewer` role check;
  index error-ranking and payload immutability semantics). Walked
  `vdp-disclosures/anthropic-plugin-dev-cmd-injection/` →
  `corpus/knowledge/vdp-disclosure-packages.md` (4-file shape: ROUTE.md /
  cover-note.md / report.md / SUBMITTED.md; free + attributed decree;
  security.txt Contact → H1 embedded_submissions route; operator sends
  personally). Sampled 5 Cantina sibling ingestions → `program-quirks.md`
  (only dydx repeats positive-blocked-live-precondition; $100 fee is
  Pendle-specific so far). SKILL.md gained the enforced-gate summary + VDP
  sibling-format section. `corpus/lessons/round-3.md` recorded.
